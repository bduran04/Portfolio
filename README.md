## [Description](#description)
This is my updated portfolio that contains a header component that is displayed on multiple pages, and a separate page displaying 6 of my projects including a gif, and a link to each Github. The projects are rendered by mapping through multiple props on a single "Project" component. My portfolio also contains links to my LinkedIn & Github. This was created using Material-UI and React.
